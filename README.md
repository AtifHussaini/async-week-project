# NBA JAM Vol. 1

### The Premise

Created a fun and exciting demo game where two teams consisting of 5 NBA players each, battle against one another to see whose team scores the most points. Teams are randomly selected from the top 100 players in the league (according to NBA 2k23). The app features graphics of the top players in the league with their overall rankings (according to NBA 2k23), a smooth UI with and the NBA theme song from the 90's. To make the game interesting, players and teams are selected at random and on the click of "Tip-Off", a winner is determined by whose teams overall score is the greatest. Overall, this game was designed for a laid-back, entertaining experience for users.
